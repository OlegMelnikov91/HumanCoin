# HumanCoin
Alternative organization has been operating for 9 years and managed to free more than 1600 enslaved people. However, 46 million people all over the world still live in different forms of slavery. In order to expandits rescuing activity and amount of operations executed, Alternative issues a cryptocurrency â€“ HumanCoin.The main issue Alternative has been facing during its existence is a lack of funding. As a result, sometimes we were persuaded to choose what operation to conduct, literally - whom to rescue and whom to abandonto their destiny.Thanks to the HumanCoin emission, it will be possible to transform organization from charity to a self-sustaining non-profit. HumanCoin will be used by firms as a payment for the antislavery certification other economic activities. This scheme will create revenue streams that will ultimately allow to free more enslaved people.
